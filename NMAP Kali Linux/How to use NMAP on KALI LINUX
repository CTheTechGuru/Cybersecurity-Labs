1.This is how you use the NMAP command. 

It is important you only run on servers you have permission to run this command on. You could  potentially affect services on a domain without permission which could result in consequences. 

Scanme.nmap.org gives us permission to scan with the nmap command;however, It is noted to not abuse or the service. 

First we will use the dig command to translate the ip address of scanme.nmap.org 



Or IP id 45.33.32.156 We will now use the nmap command to scan the scanme.nmap.org 

Results. 
Notice it shows the list of ports, protocols, and state of the ports. This could be a useful tool for discovering vulnerabilities or hardening a hosts networking configuration. 

Port Scanning
![Port Scanning](https://github.com/CTheTechGuru/Cybersecurity-Labs/assets/125163096/41456624-9988-430b-9987-e0975f144607)

We can target specific ports instead of doing a full nmap scan. To achieve this run the command

nmap -p [desired port number] (ip addr)
Ex: nmap -p 22 192.168.0.1

Fingerprinting / OS Detection

nmap -O (ip addr)
Ex: nmap -O 22 192.168.0.1

Aggressive Scan - Allows us to retrieve OS detection, traceroute, version detection, ports, services public keys, services and more. 

nmap -A  (ip addr)
Ex: nmap  -A 192.168.0.1


Output results of a nmap scan to a file 
Nmap -o /home/(user)/nmap.org.txt -A Target-IP
